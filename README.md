# A standalone project for replicating the UI

A standalone project developed using flutter 2.5.0. The project mainly focuses on different mobile screen sizes(tablets not included), The project includes a single screen which has a list of widgets taken from the supplied figma design. There are no external dependencies on this project, all the widgets are developed using the standard sdk widgets.

-In order to run this project, clone this repository and make sure you have the recent version of the flutter sdk. You can find it -[here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
-You can choose any IDE of your choice, I have made use of Visual Studio code. If you are using Visual Studio Code make sure to configure the IDE with all the necessary plugins.
-If you are willing to build it for both android and ios make sure you have Android studio and Xcode installed.
-The folder structure is pretty straight forward, all the widgets and screen reside inside the presentation folder, the different set of colors are inside the /constants.dart file. The text data is present inside /app_data.dart.
-The main.dart file is the entry point of the project.
-The test folder has a very basic widget test.
